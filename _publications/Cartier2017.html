        We present photometry and time-series spectroscopy of the nearby type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2015F over −16 days to +80 days relative to maximum light, obtained as part of the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO). SN 2015F is a slightly sub-luminous SN Ia with a decline rate of Δm15(B)=1.35±0.03 mag, placing it in the region between normal and SN 1991bg-like events. Our densely-sampled photometric data place tight constraints on the epoch of first light and form of the early-time light curve. The spectra exhibit photospheric C II λ6580 absorption until −4 days, and high-velocity Ca II is particularly strong at <−10 days at expansion velocities of ≃23000\kms. At early times, our spectral modelling with syn++ shows strong evidence for iron-peak elements (Fe II, Cr II, Ti II, and V II) expanding at velocities >14000 km s−1, suggesting mixing in the outermost layers of the SN ejecta. Although unusual in SN Ia spectra, including V II in the modelling significantly improves the spectral fits. Intriguingly, we detect an absorption feature at ∼6800 \AA\ that persists until maximum light. Our favoured explanation for this line is photospheric Al II, which has never been claimed before in SNe Ia, although detached high-velocity C II material could also be responsible. In both cases the absorbing material seems to be confined to a relatively narrow region in velocity space. The nucleosynthesis of detectable amounts of Al II would argue against a low-metallicity white dwarf progenitor. We also show that this 6800 \AA\ feature is weakly present in other normal SN Ia events, and common in the SN 1991bg-like sub-class.
