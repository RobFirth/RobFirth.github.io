# Ogden Conference 2017, Cambridge

___

Last week I headed up to Cambridge for the Ogden Science Officer Conference 2017, and now Isaac Physics and the Ogden Trust are working closely together (so closely that my job title has changed to Ogden-Isaac Fellow), I was invited along. The meeting ran from Wednesday to Friday, and we heard from a number of the OSO's about projects they had worked on, as well as other invited speakers.

I met up with Jen Gupta [@jen_gupta](https://twitter.com/jen_gupta) at Winchester, originally Southampton's very own Sadie Jones [@sotonastrodome](https://twitter.com/sotonastrodome) was going to be coming too, but had other commitments in the end. Even without Sadie, we collected quite a mob by the time we got onto the Cambridge train:
