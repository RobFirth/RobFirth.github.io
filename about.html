            <p>
              Hello!
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm Rob, and I'm currently a Ogden-Isaac Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Southampton Department of Physics and Astronomy. I have been in this role since I finished my PhD, in October 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently I spend half of my working time on the <a href="https://isaacphysics.org/">Isaac Physics Project</a>, working with the University, local schools, Teachers and A-level students with an aim to improve the problem solving skills (and overall university application rates) of AS/A-Level Physics and Maths students.
            </p>

            <p>
              The other half of my time is spent as a researcher within the Southampton Supernova Group, where my research interests include creating training sets for machine learning classification in next generation sky surveys (particularly LSST), and using the diversity of Type Ia Supernovae as a diagnostic for their explosion physics and progenitor configuration. you can find a list of my publications <a href="publications"> here</a> and more details about my <a href="about">research interests here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout my PhD and current post-doc I've written a <emph>lot</emph> of code, mainly python (both 2.7 and 3+), but I've also used IDL and dabbled with C/C++. Some more details of the software development I've been involved with can be found on the appropriately named page, <a href="code"> here</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              When I've found something handy, or have been having a play around with a new tool, or dataset, I might write about it. These ramblings are in <a href="posts">Posts</a>.
            </p>

              My contact details are below, and can also be found (in more detail) <a href="contact">here</a>.

              Thanks!
